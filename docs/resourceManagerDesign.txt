Resource manager is responsible for allocating and destroying all “resources”. 
A resource can be a mesh, interior, material.
Resource manager gives you access to all of the meshes, interiors, materials, ect. So if you just wanted a specific resource, u can grab that list. OR if you want everything, there’s a big momma list as well.
When we do regular render, instead of doing per-object rendering, we do per material/shader rendering. This is much more efficient for sending OpenGL commands.
Instead of doing:
Foreach (obj in list) {
	renderObject();
}
We do this:
Foreach (Material in ResourceManager::materials)
{
    foreach (object in material)
    {
         renderObject();
    }
}
Material resources hold references to meshresources, which is a base class of interior resources and shape resources.
Materials are generated via JSON structures. However. I have a slight problem with this. For example, HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT MATERIAL BELONGS TO WHAT OBJECT????? TODO I need to figure this out.
